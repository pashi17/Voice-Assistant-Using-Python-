I recently built a Voice Assistant project using Python, where I combined my own coding knowledge with the help of AI tools to make it more efficient and feature-rich.

This assistant can perform multiple tasks using voice commands, such as:
✅ Telling the current time and date 🕒
✅ Giving live weather updates 🌦️
✅ Opening applications like Notepad, Calculator, Chrome, Paint, and more 💻
✅ Searching the web and opening popular websites like YouTube, Google, Gmail, and LinkedIn 🌐
✅ Telling fun jokes and responding interactively 😄

💻 Tech Stack Used:

Python 🐍

pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech)

SpeechRecognition (Voice Input)

Requests (Weather API)

Datetime, Webbrowser, OS, Platform modules

Some parts of the code and structure were implemented by me, while I used AI assistance for optimization, voice configuration, and debugging.
This project helped me learn more about speech processing, automation, and AI integration in real-world applications.

🚀 Excited to enhance it further with features like reminders, chatting, and smarter responses!
